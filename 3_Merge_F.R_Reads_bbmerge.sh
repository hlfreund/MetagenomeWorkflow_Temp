## Notes
# Basic merging (link = https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/bb-tools-user-guide/bbmerge-guide/)
#bbmerge.sh in=reads.fq out=merged.fq outu=unmerged.fq ihist=ihist.txt
#This will merge the reads by overlap. If no best overlap is found, the pair will go to outu; otherwise, the reads will be merged and sent to out. After finishing, an insert size histogram will be written to ihist.txt. This can be produced even if “out” or “outu” are not specified.

# Merging of nonoverlapping reads using kmers:
# bbmerge-auto.sh in=reads.fq out=merged.fq outu=unmerged.fq ihist=ihist.txt ecct extend2=20 iterations=5

# This will attempt to merge each pair by overlap. If unsuccessful, both reads will be error-corrected using Tadpole, and then merging will be tried again. If still unsuccessful, both reads will be extended by 20bp, then merging will be attempted again. This will repeat up to 5 times, or until neither of the reads can be extended any more due to a branch or dead-end in the kmer graph. If the reads are not merged, all of the changes are undone and the original pair will be sent to outu. “extend2=20 iterations=5” will extend each read by up to 100bp, which increases the maximum insert sizes that can be merged by 200bp. So, for example, a 2x150bp library can normally only merge inserts up to around 290bp; this would extend that capability to 490bp, and the middle would be filled in with assembled bases.
